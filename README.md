**Current Initiative: osu! Tournament Rating**
A fully-featured data visualization suite & elo-like rating system for osu! tournament players.
- Currently closed source - but will be fully open once we're ready :)

**General Software:**

- [Yuzuru](https://github.com/hburn7/Yuzuru) | A fun Discord bot with a small feature set. The nice thing about this project is my ability to quickly whip up custom tools for my own Discord servers or for friends. Currently active, join the [Yuzuru Discord](https://discord.gg/GkFR4xGKMM)!
